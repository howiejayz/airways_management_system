Your team is employed by an Airways company for the implementation of a computer system
responsible for a large part of the operation of the company.
Customer specifications

- The system must be able to store the information of planes, flights and passengers of the company during
the years of its operation. There are two types of planes P62 & P124 with rectangular arrangements of
6 x 2 & 12 x 4 seats, respectively. The sources and destinations of the currently available flights of the
company (for simplicity, assume only direct flights) are allocated from a set of city airports which can
be potentially extended. The different passengers can be allocated to specific flights and seats.
The system should be able to provide functionality to the different users listed below:
  - An administrator who can include new flights, prices, dates, airports and perhaps new planes
for each of the two available types.
  - A tick et agent who can flexibly search for a specific flight inquired by a customer. When the
customer reserves or books a ticket, then the required details must be stored. Such information
includes flight id, payment details, expiration date of reservation, rou te, allocated seat, viewing
facilities of the seating plan, etc. Facilities to amend this information must be provided.
  - A manager who can retrieve statistics about the companyâ€™s operation, such as the number of
planes for each type, total passengers per fl ight, total revenue, etc.
